# Google Material Icons in React

## Why?

There is a popular and well thought out library already out there called [material-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mui/icons-material) which does more or less the same job as this library, but will cause [@mui/material](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mui/material) to be added to your project as an indirect dependency.

## Installation

After installing the package, you will need the following reference added somewhere in your react html.

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

## Usage

```tsx

```
